                                    <p>After iCracked repairs the device, the warranty does not protect against:</p><ul><li>Subsequent mishandling that causes the frame to bend, twist, or crack</li>

    <li>Battery replacements. &nbsp;Batteries are considered a consumable product and iCracked does not offer a lifetime warranty on battery replacements.</li>
    </ul><p>Our warranty also does not cover the outcome of a repair if certain pre-repair conditions exist, including:</p><ul><li>Existence of known manufacturing and/or performance issues related to the device separate from the repair, as noted prior to the repair</li>
    <li>Existence of damage to the frame of device, as noted prior to the repair</li>
    <li>Water damage</li>
    <li>Jailbroken devices</li>
    <li>Tampering with internal hardware: under certain conditions, internal damage may make a repair impossible. Your iTech or repair specialist will be able to explain in further detail upon diagnosing your specific device. If in doubt, we recommend that you do not attempt to repair on your own, as any damage may affect the reparability of your device.</li>
    <li>a NON-Working, damaged or severed home button/Bio-Metric scanner</li>

If payment was not rendered for service, the repair quote shall be deducted from the value, or a refurbished device of the same damaged condition as received shall be offered. In order to receive a replacement device, the customer's damaged device must be rendered to iCracked.</p><ul><li>In the case that the repair is performed by an iTech, the iTech is responsible for the replacement and should be contacted directly. iTech Customers are also welcome to contact iCracked HQ to notify us of a repair issue, however, liability shall rest with the iTech who performed the service.</li>

Further, I agree to release, indemnify, and hold iCracked Inc. from liability for any claims or damages of any kind or description that may arise from any iOS device repair work performed on my iPhone™, iPad™, or iPod™, unless it is caused by severe negligence of iCracked, or its agent.</p><p>I understand that iCracked Inc. has no liability for any data loss, which may occur as a result of work done on my iOS device. I also understand that I have the option to, and I am responsible for backing up the device before allowing iCracked to work on my device in the event of any data loss and hardware or software failure.</p><p>I understand that repairs or technical support rendered by iCracked may void manufacturer warranties for this iOS device. iCracked and its affiliates do not assume any liability or warranty in the event that the manufacturer warranties are voided but may, at its sole discretion, offer its own warranty on the parts and/or services performed.</p><p>I further understand that it is my responsibility to inform iCracked accurately with regard to the model description and condition of my iOS device, as well as whether any modifications or repairs have previously been attempted or completed. An iCracked repair specialist will perform a check-in diagnosis of my device to evaluate its condition. If the device arrives at iCracked in noticeably different condition than previously described, I acknowledge that additional charges may apply. I understand that an iCracked repair specialist will contact me to discuss the discrepancies and potential additional costs.</p><p>As the customer, I recognize that the careful shipping of my iOS device to iCracked is my responsibility. If the product arrives with further damage, or is lost in transit, I bear full responsibility for that risk of loss as the shipper.</p><p>If any device should be lost or damaged further than the condition it was released to iCracked in, iCracked’s liability will be limited to the cost of repair or replacement of the device in its condition at the time of transfer to iCracked based on current fair market value. iCracked’s liability for damages from any cause when it comes to repairing your product is limited to the cost of the repair service or a comparable replacement device. iCracked and its affiliates have no liability whatsoever for indirect or consequential damages resulting from a repair or repair attempt, including any lost or damaged data, software, or lost profits or revenue of the customer.</p>
